# Object and Color Detection with OpenCV

Welcome to the Object and Color Detection project using the OpenCV library. This repository contains Python code for both object detection and color detection tasks.

## Overview

This repository hosts Python scripts that demonstrate two fundamental computer vision tasks:

1. **Object Detection**: Use OpenCV to detect and locate objects within images or video streams. Object detection is a critical component in various applications, including image processing, robotics, and more.

2. **Color Detection**: Explore the capabilities of OpenCV for identifying and extracting specific colors from images or video. Color detection plays a significant role in applications like image segmentation and tracking.

## Features

- Simple and well-structured Python code.
- Two key computer vision tasks demonstrated: Object Detection and Color Detection.
- Built using the powerful OpenCV library.
- Easily adaptable for use in your own projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/opencv-object-color-detection.git
